# How Many Samples are Needed to Estimate a CNN

In this paper[1], authors make contributions to the study about rigorous characterization of the sample complexity of estimating CNNs, for they found there were no convincing explanation about why CNNs works better than FNNs (the folklore explaining it is that CNNs use a more compact representation than FNNs). They show, for an conv filter with linear activation function, its sample complexity of achieving population prediction error on the same input is smaller than its FNN counterpart, thus this is CNNs' advantage.
