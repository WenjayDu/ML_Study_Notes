# Y Continuous Learning is the key 2 ML

Before, I was curious about the importance of Continual Learning(like Lifelong Learning): now that we have trained the NN and got the model, what the significance of continual learning? Does it really make sense? Therefore, I searched for some articles about this concept.

Firstly, the term "Lifelong Learning" has been around for years in the field of AI, and nowadays people prefer to use “Continuous” or “Continual Learning” which is more modern to describe some algorithms about Deep Learning.

When it comes to the difference between "Continual" and "Continuous", as said in Oxford Dictionaries: 
> Both can mean roughly “without interruption” […] however, Continuous is much more prominent in this sense and, unlike Continual, can be used to refer to space as well as time […]. Continual, on the other hand, typically means ‘happening frequently, with intervals between’ […].

So what is the Continuous Learning(CL)? From what has been discussed above, we know that, on the base of learning continuously and adaptively about the external environment which keeps changing, it is able to autonomously develop more complex skills and knowledge. And obviously, it builds itself on the top of previously learned knowledge.

Secondly, regarding to the reason why we need CL, it is indispensable to talk about what is intelligence? What the definition of Intelligence? One concise and clear definition is quoted from Sternberg & Salter in the “Handbook of Human Intelligence”: `Goal-directed adaptive behavior.` The point is "adaptive", the "Adaption". To enable the machine intelligent enough to handle problems occurring in the changing environment, we must enable it to adapt the environment autonomously. 

Not only able to realize continual improvement and unsupervised learning, CL is also capable of making Multimodel-Multitask Learning come true, which is seen as the only way to realize strong AI. BTW, in the scene of Multimodel-Multitask, we will have different streams of data from different sensors and we also have to handle different tasks at the meanwhile.
