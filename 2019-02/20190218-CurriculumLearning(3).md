# Curriculum learning

CL is beneficial to ML algorithms, but the teaching process is difficult because people have different ideas about the order in which teaching content should be introduced. What should be paid attention to is that at any point of the learning, examples introduced to the learner should not be too easy or too difficult, and should be "interesting". Interesting examples stand near the frontier of learner's knowledge and abilities.

The 2 advantages of CL are: 1. accelerating the training in the online setting; 2. guiding training to better regions in param space. 

CL is related to boosting algorithms. Although a curriculum starts with an easier examples and difficult examples are gradually emphasized, the training criteria do not change.
