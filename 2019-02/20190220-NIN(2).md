For classification in traditional CNNs, feature maps of the last conv layer are fed into fully connected layers(FCLs) followed by a softmax logistic regression layer. However, the FCLs are prone to overfitting. Therefore, authors present a strategy call the global average pooling(GAP) to replace FCLs. 

There are 2 advantages of the GAP that

* it can be used over feature maps in the classification layer that means it is easier to interpret feature maps as categories confidence maps.
* there is no param to optimize in GAP, hence, overfitting is avoided in it.

And it is noteworthy that it is mlpconv layers that makes utilizing GAP possible, because GAP enforce feature maps to be categories confidence maps and in the meanwhile mlpconv layers makes better approximation to the confidence maps than GLMs, that mean mlpconv has stronger receptive filed. So we can see mlpconv layers are a prerequisite for using GAP.
