# Network In Network
 
The convolution filter in traditional CNNs is the generalized linear model(GLM), however, authors argue that GLM has low abstraction ability, though GLM performs well when samples of the latent concepts are linearly separable. But in fact, data of the same concept is often nonlinear that means GLM's performance on tasks of classifying these samples. Therefore, authors present a new DNN structure, called "Network In Network", i.e. NIN, for classification tasks.

In NIN, GLM is replaced by the micro network structure which is a general nonlinear function approximator. Authors use the multilayer perceptron(mlp) as the implement of the micro network and the resulting structure is called the mlpconv layer. In this more complex structure, data in receptive field can be abstracted. Deep NIN can be implemented by stacking multiple such structure.
