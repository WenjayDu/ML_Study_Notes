# Curriculum learning

A curriculum can be seen as a series of training criteria and each criteria is related to a different set of weights on training examples, and during the training, these weights tend to change to sample more difficult examples. 

Experiments shows that the learner trained with easier examples is able to generalize better than the one trained with more difficult examples, though difficult examples have more information than easier ones, which may sound like an advantage, but difficult examples probably cannot help the learner because too much information make the learner confused.
