# FitNets

The training of FitNets is based on hints, which are the output of a teacher's hidden layer. Correspondingly, a hidden layer of the FitNet is chosen as the guided one. And the target we want to get is that the guided layer is capable of predicting the output of the teacher's guiding layer. 

One problem should be paid attention to is that having hints is a form of regularization, so to prevent the student NN from being over-regularized, both hint and guided layers should be chosen carefully, because the deeper we set the guided layer, the less flexibility we give to the NN, and the result is the FitNet is more easier to be over-regularized.

Additionally, now that the FitNet is thinner, outputs of the hint layer are more than those of the guided layer in FitNet. Therefore, authors add a convolutional regressor to the guided layer to make outputs match the size of the hint layer.
