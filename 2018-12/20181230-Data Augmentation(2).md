# Data Augmetation

In yesterday's notes, authors use GANs to generate augmented data before training the net. One method is that they use GANs and traditional augmentation techniques(affine transformation, rotate, flip, shifted, distort, shift, zoom in/out, list here to make myself familiar with them) to generate more images and feed these images into the net to train it(generated images as training and test dataset, and only the original images used to validate). Another method used by authors is to use a pretrained NN to learn augmentation. In this method, a style transfer NN is used to augment data, then use augmented images and original images together to train another classifying NN.

After a series of experiments, authors conclude that neural augmentation performs much better than no augmentation. Admittedly, traditional augmentation is effective alone, but other techniques like CycleGAN and other similar NNs are promising. Authors presume that maybe the result can be better if we combine the traditional augmentation with neural augmentation. Authors also hope such data augmentation techniques could help improve the current best algorithm for classification. Applying these techniques more genericly may be able to make data collecting easier.
