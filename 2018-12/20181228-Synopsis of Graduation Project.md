## Title: Deep Learning on Edge Devices by Deep Compression
### Subtitle: a case study on medical image analysis on mobile phones
<hr/>

### Content and Purpose
Design a U-Net with related algorithm and make it learn from medical images. Then, tune and train it to obatin the model which is capable of analyzing medical images.

Further work is to compress this model. Because deep neural networks are not only computationally intensive but also memory intensive, mobile devices with limited hardware resources are confronted with difficulities when running models of deep neural networks. Therefore, to enable the target model to be deployed on mobile devices, the model should be compressed to reduce required storage and energy and in the meanwhile, model's accuracy should not be affected.

### Requirements
#### 1. Skilled in using Python, Docker, CI process
* Python: as the main programming language, including ML frameworks, like Keras, Tensorflow;

* Docker: build ML development environment with docker, build images and run them as containers, manage clusters with Kubernetes;

* CI process: Git as VCS, GitLab as code hosting platform, Jenkins as automation server, all of them implement the whole CI process;

#### 2. Familar with U-Net
The whole network is based on the U-Net which is an outstanding network proposed in 2015 that can be trained on very few training data sets, especially useful in the biomedical field for thousands of training images are usually beyond reach. To get the well-performing model and compress it, the student on this project should well know about U-Net architechure and be able to use it skillfully. 

#### 3. Knowledge about model compression
The core part of this project is to compress the trained model to enable it running on edge devices like mobile phones. To achieve a satisfactory compression ratio, the student on this project ought to have a grasp of knowledge about mainstream model compression methods.
