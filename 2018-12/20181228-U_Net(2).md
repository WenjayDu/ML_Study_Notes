# U-Net

Why U-Net is able to learn well from limitted amount of training data and get a satisfactory accuracy rate, this question aroused my interest on it after I read the introduction of U-Net yesterday. 

Different from other images, biomedical images have elastic deformations, as I saied yesterday these deformations used to be the most common variation in tissue, however, not only because of this, but also becasue these deformations are easy to be simulated, data augmentation can play a vital role in training these biomedical segmentation network with few available images. Tomorrow I will read the paper[1] to learn about data augmentation.

U-Net is modified from FCN, but one important modification is that U-Net has a lot of channels in the upsampling part, authors say this "allow the network to propagate context information to higher resolution layers", but why1⃣️❓, I don't understand right now, after I fix it, I will write the answer at the bottom. 

As authors say, another challenge in cell segmentation task is the seperation of touching objectes of the same class, because if there are many cells, they will be close together, then it is hard to seperate them from each other, let alone if they are of the same class. To slove this problem, authors propose the use of weighted loss, they say "where the separating background labels between touching cells obtain a large weight in the loss function". What does this mean2⃣️❓ Ok, this is the second question.

Well, today I get two questions for myself. I see them as rewards and I will figure them out later. U-Net is quite interest, after I get the TX2 from Prof. Zhang, I will make my own one, tune and train it.
