# Intro of BIDS

The BIDS(brain imaging data structure), a standard format for organizing and describing datasets of neuroimaging experiments, is presented by authors in the context that although MRI(Magnetic Resonance Imaging), a technique can be used for non-invasive study of the brain, is usually used to obtain the data for the research in the field of neuroscience, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing collected data. Obviously, this hinders researchers from sharing and reusing data. About BIDS's features, just like authors say, `The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.`

BIDS provides several benefits:

* **Minimized curation**: BIDS makes it possible for researchers who were not directly involved in data collection to understand and work with the data.
* **Error reduction**: BIDS helps reduce errors caused by misunderstanding of meanings of given data.
* **Optimized usage of data analysis software**: Because of capturing the metadata, BIDS makes it feasible that data can be processed by some data analysis softwares, which significantly improves efficiency.
* **Development of automated tools**: BIDS has promoted the development of automated tools used to verify the consistency and completeness of datasets, which can help spot missing metadata.
