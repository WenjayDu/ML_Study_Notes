# Discrimination-aware Channel Pruning

At each stage of Discrimination-aware channel pruning, authors first construct the additional loss ***L***<sup>p</sup><sub>S</sub> and put them at the layer ***L***<sub>p</sub>, then learn the model params and fine-tune the model at the same time with both additional loss and final loss, this will make params updated. After fine-tuning with ***L***<sup>p</sup><sub>S</sub> and ***L***<sub>f</sub>, the discriminative power of layers l ‚àà { ***L***<sub>p-1</sub>, ..., ***L***<sub>p</sub>} can be significantly improved.


To optimizing discriminative-aware channel pruning, authors design a greedy algo to select channel and optimize params in a iterative way. The selection method consists of 2 steps. First, select the most important channels of input feature maps. At each iteration, compute gradients and use them to determine the ùíú (see the algo in the original paper for details), which is the index set of selected channels. Second, apply SGD to handle the problem w.r.t. ùíú.


Authors‚Äô main contributions can be divided into two aspects. One is they propose the discriminative-aware channel pruning method for compressing deep networks. The other is they formulate the channel selection problem and present a greed alog to solve the optimization problem.
