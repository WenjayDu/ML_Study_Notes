# MobileNet

The other hyper param applied in MobileNets to reduce cost of computation is resolution multiplier. Authors apply it to the input image to low down the image resolution, as a result, the internal representation of each layer is subsequently reduced. This is how it works.

In experiments, authors show that compared with the MobileNet using full convolutions, the one using depth-wise separable convolutions only reduces accuracy by 1%, but has 7 times less params. Another comparison indicates that at similar computation and quantity of params, making MobileNets thinner can get better performance than making them shallower.

With experiments, authors demonstrate MobileNet's effectiveness in a wide range of tasks. Use cases include fine grained recognition, large scale geo-localization, face attributes and object detection.
