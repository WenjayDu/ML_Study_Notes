# MorphNet

The MorphNet in this paper, which is a method to automate design of NN, was proposed under such a circumstance that automatic NN architecture design was available only under many restrictions, and even it works, the time and hardware resources need for training is prohibitive. 

As authors said, MorphNet has 3 advantages: 

1. its scalability. MorphNet can train large models with large datasets;
2. its optimization can be targeted. MorphNet can optimize a net structure targeting a specified resource like FLOPs per inference, in the meanwhile allowing to use untargeted resources like num of params;
3. its 2-way optimization. MorphNet can learn a net structure, which can not only improve model performance, but also reduce the usage of targeted resource;

Authors highlight the simplicity of their proposed iterative process, and different from a school of approaches that have started to care about resources rather than maximizing the performance.
